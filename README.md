# The-Agent-Equation-Balancing-Workload-and-Efficiency-to-Elevate-Customer-Interactions
The Customer Experience (CX) team is a vital component of any company, as they 
are tasked with analyzing customer feedback and data, extracting valuable insights, 
and disseminating these insights throughout the organization. Their responsibilities 
encompass a broad spectrum of tasks, such as overseeing customer experience 
programs, facilitating internal communications, mapping out customer journeys, and 
managing customer data, among other duties. In today's age, numerous AI-powered 
tools are being employed to elevate the customer experience. These tools encompass 
Interactive Voice Response (IVR), Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Predictive 
Analytics, and Intelligent Routing.

In this project, the focus will be on Customer Experience (CX) analytics, with a specific 
emphasis on the inbound calling team of a company. The dataset provided covers a 
period of 23 days and contains a range of information, including the agent's name and
ID, queue time (the duration customers waited before connecting with an agent), call 
time, call duration, and call status (abandoned, answered, or transferred).
